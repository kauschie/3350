1. What did you learn from pair programming?

I learned that not everybody has the same strengths as everybody else when it 
comes to programming. Some people may excel in one area while others may excel
in completely different areas. This is one of the advantages to pair programming;
the strengths of each member of the pair are additive and together they are able
to produce better code. There's always two pairs of eyes on the code which also
leads to a reduced amount of bugs/errors.
